## ‚å®Ô∏è Introduction

Haxic is a project that implements a modern reinterpretation of the BASIC programming language using *Haxe*. It aims to bring together simplicity, nostalgia, and modern programming conveniences. Users can write code in a simple BASIC-inspired syntax, which Haxic will process (interpret / compile / transpile) it using Haxe tooling. ([github.com](https://github.com/ProgrammingLover71/haxic))

---

## üìú Features

* A mainly BASIC-inspired syntax for writing programs
* Modern syntax features, such as arrays, maps, lambda functions (function expressions) ans closures
* Parsing and interpreting or compiling that code using Haxe
* Cross-platform support via compilation targets (the Haxic compiler is WIP)
* Example programs shipped with the repo for demonstration
* A simple, straightforward REPL and a way to execute scripts

---

## ‚ùìÔ∏è Motivation

Why build Haxic?

* To revive and enjoy the simplicity and syntax that BASIC dialects had, but with modern features too
* To leverage Haxe‚Äôs cross-platform capabilities so that Haxic programs can run in many environments
* To learn & experiment with building interpreters / compilers in Haxe
* To provide a lightweight educational tool for learning programming / language design

---

## üìï Architecture & Design

* **Source code** is in `src/`
* **Examples** are in `examples/`
* Output or build artifacts may go into `out/` (e.g. `out/py`)
* A build script (`build.bat`) is present for Windows users
* Implemented in Haxe; the source code is precompiled to Python/C++

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Haxe (latest stable version recommended)
* On Windows: ability to run `.bat` scripts

### üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ProgrammingLover71/haxic.git
cd haxic

# Build / compile
# On Windows:
./build.bat

# On Unix systems
haxe -main src/Main.hx -py out/py/haxic.py -D release -D analyzer-optimize
haxe -main src/Main.hx -cpp out/cpp -D release -D analyzer-optimize
```

### üíæ Running files

Haxic has a REPL and a compiler/interpreter, both of which can be run as follows:

```bash
# Python build:
py out/py/haxic.py file (-py out_file) # Omit file for REPL, add the last part to use the compiler

# C++ build:
out/cpp/haxic file (-py out_file) # Omit file for REPL, add the last part to use the compiler
```

---

## üìå Usage

### ‚úíÔ∏è Writing code in Haxic

Write `.hxc` files using BASIC-style syntax. Example:

```haxic
print "Hello!";
input a;
if a > 10 then
    print "A is large";
else
    print"A is small";
end
```

### üî¨ Examples

See the `examples/` folder for sample programs. These programs also act as language feature tests.

## üìä Performance

On average, Haxic's C++ build features a performance similar to that of Python, if not greater. The Python build is about 50x slower, but has a great performance for short programs.
Also, the new compiler (that generates Python code for now) creates programs that are up to *10-15 times faster* than the C++ tree-walk interpreter.
This said, another compiler is being built that will generate pure C++ code, with a hopefully huge performance boost, and a bytecode VM is also planned for the near future.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Contributing

All contributions are welcome! Here are some ways you could help out with development:
1. Fork the project
2. Create a branch for proposed features / bugfixes
3. Add tests or examples if possible
4. Ensure the source code works across targets
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description

## üìã Roadmap

* Improved error messages
* More target backends for the compiler/interpreter (JavaScript, etc.)
* Optimizations for compilation
* Packaging & distribution
* Modules
* OOP Features
* A larger standard library
* Haxic compiler (partially finished)
